# SOC_CODE

## General info
This project aims to help in understanding the role of various spin structures (Magnetic LRO + SOC) on the measurable quantities of a given system.
The spin structures can be added to a model tight-binding Hamiltonian(TBH) by hand or by provided scripts (in-progress). 
The code fits between the wannierization step, which maps the DFT problem onto a tight-binding Hamiltonian, and the wanniertools step, which extracts the measurable
quantities from the TBH.
