# SOC_CODE 

## General info
This project aims to help in understanding the role of various spin structures (Magnetic LRO + SOC) on the measurable quantities of a given system.
The spin structures can be added to a model tight-binding Hamiltonian(TBH) by hand or by provided scripts (in-progress). 
The code fits between the wannierization step, which maps the DFT problem onto a tight-binding Hamiltonian, and the wanniertools step, which extracts the measurable
quantities from the TBH.

## Usage
To run the code, just execute main.py with flags. For more information, run 
`python3 app/main.py -h`

## Requirements
To run the code, one needs just Python (3.+) with NumPy.
